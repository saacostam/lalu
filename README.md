# ðŸŽµ LALU

This is a spotify-like frontend application created as a class project for the ``Software Architecture`` course at ``Universidad Nacional de Colombia``.

The original project had a distributed microservices backend with multiple programming languages and components. Currently, the front-end application uses static mock-data to simulate the original behavior of the application.
