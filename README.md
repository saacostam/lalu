# ðŸŽµ LALU 

This is a spotify-like frontend application created as a class project for the ``Software Architecture`` course at ``National University of Colombia``.

The original project had a distributed microservices backend with multiple programming languages and components. Currently, the front-end application uses static mock-data to simulate the original behavior of the application.
