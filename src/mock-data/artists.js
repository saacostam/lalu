        description: 'Fred describes his music as ‘Actual Life’, a trademark sound that features vocals uncovered from the unlikeliest of sources; from obscure YouTube clips to personal FaceTime conversations, random Instagram accounts and iPhone video footage of half-remembered nights out. The end results – often made on the move wherever Fred has his laptop – shift between dancefloor-inspired euphoria and yearning melancholy and you’ll hear the likes of The Blessed Madonna, Mr Eazi and Headie One among lesser known voices.'

        description: `The Beatles recorded together for a little over seven years. Between October 1962 and May 1970, they released thirteen albums and a number of tracks issued on standalone singles. The catalogue created in that short period has sold more than that of any other group in history and its commercial success continues - the world’s best selling album during the first decade of the 21st century was a collection of The Beatles’ chart-topping singles called 1. But the group’s significance stems not just from huge sales figures. Their music has inspired generation upon generation of musicians, songwriters and producers. As Mark Ronson put it: ‘Everything we take for granted - they absolutely invented it.’ Tom Petty was a teenager during the years The Beatles’ records appeared in quick succession: ‘They were just out in front. There was The Beatles …and then there was everyone else. And everyone else could be great, but The Beatles were leading the way and that’s just irrefutably true.’`

        description: `Jack Back has enabled EDM superstar David Guetta to revert to his roots in progressive house, fully explored with the full-length Jack Back Mixtape (2018).

        The alias dates back to 2012, the year it was attributed to "Wild One Two" -- a collaboration with Nicky Romero and Sia -- and also became the name of a Guetta-operated subsidiary of Spinnin' Records. Through 2017, the Jack Back label issued over a dozen singles, including several credited to Guetta by name, but the tag didn't reappear as a headlining artist name until September 2018, when Jack Back Mixtape became available for streaming and download. Presented as a DJ mix, the full-length was issued through Parlophone with singles such as "Pelican" and "Overtone" incorporated with previously unreleased material. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi`
